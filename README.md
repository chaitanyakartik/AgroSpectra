# 🪨 OreNexus: Mining Smarter — Mapping Impact, Value, and Compliance Gaps

**OreNexus** is a software tool that leverages satellite imagery (EO/SAR) and AI to automatically detect, monitor, and analyze open crust mining activities.  
It provides a comprehensive solution for **government authorities**, **environmental agencies**, and **mining corporations** to track compliance, assess environmental impact, and gain economic insights.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Traditional monitoring of open crust mining is often manual and inefficient.  
Tracking the exact extent of mining operations in real-time is challenging, making it difficult to detect when activities extend beyond legally authorized boundaries (defined by Shapefiles or KML files).  

This lack of oversight can lead to:
- Unchecked **illegal mining**
- Severe **environmental degradation**
- **Revenue loss** for governing bodies

Hence, there is a need for an **automated system** to:
- Delineate mining areas  
- Identify illegal operations  
- Calculate extraction volumes  
- Visualize the data for effective decision-making

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔹 Automated Mining Detection  
Utilizes an in-house AI/ML model trained on historical satellite data to automatically identify and delineate open crust mining areas.

### 🔹 Illegal Activity Flagging  
Compares detected mining polygons against official AOI (Area of Interest) boundaries to automatically identify and calculate the area of mining activity outside the defined lease.

### 🔹 Volumetric Analysis  
Automatically calculates mining depth and the volume of extracted material using satellite imagery and **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** data.

### 🔹 Rich Visualizations  
Offers an **interactive mapping platform** with 2D plots and 3D visualizations to view mining activities and terrain changes.

### 🔹 Comprehensive Reporting  
Generates **automated reports**, including economic dashboards and environmental impact assessments, for stakeholders and government bodies.

### 🔹 Comparative Analytics  
Allows users to compare multiple mines side-by-side on metrics such as:
- Total area  
- Ore volume  
- Ore quality  
- Percentage of illegal mining

## 🛠️ How It Works

The OreNexus system operates in **three main phases**:

### 🎓 Phase 1: Model Training (Offline)
An ML segmentation model is trained on historical satellite images and labeled ground-truth data to learn to accurately identify mining features.  
**Output:** A trained model ready for live analysis.

### 🔍 Phase 2: Live Detection & Analysis
The trained model processes **new satellite imagery and DEM data** for a given AOI.  
It:
- Detects all mining activity  
- Classifies it as legal or illegal (based on AOI boundaries)  
- Calculates metrics such as area, depth, and extracted volume  

### 📊 Phase 3: Output & Reporting
The system generates:
- Interactive **2D/3D visualizations**  
- Statistical summaries  
- Comprehensive **automated reports** for review by authorities
