Problem Statement:
Background
Detection of open crust mining activity is an important task. With the development of space based remote sensing technology and availability of the open-source medium resolution data, it has become important to automatically delineate the open crust mining area through spatial contextual modelling technique. Estimation of mining depth, mining volume, 2D and 3D visualization of the mining area using the DEM is also necessary.


Description
The above problem statement envisages that a software tool needs to be developed which should automatically detect the open crust mining activity from the satellite imagery (EO/SAR). The software/ tools should be capable of detecting the extent of open crust mining activity also. A boundary layer is usually provided during the mining lease. It is generally a Shapefile (.shp) / Kml file defining the boundary of the mining areas for which the organisation is authorised to carry out the mining activity. But sometimes the mining organisation move out of the boundary and carry out the mining. Given a boundary layer, the software should be able to identify the mining activity outside the boundary layer and automatically calculate the mining area outside the defined AoI. A plot of the mining area and area outside the defined mining AoI on map (interactive mapping platform) is also required. The tool should be capable of calculating the mining depth and volume automatically using satellite image and DEM (Simpson’s method for estimation of mining volume can be used). A 3D visualization facility should be available to visualize the mining activity in the three-dimensional environment. A report generation module should also be there in the tool to report the mining activity to the respective state or district.


Expected outcome
Development of a software tool which should be able to detect the mining area, recognise the mining area and illegal mining area from high resolution electro-optical, SAR or medium resolution multispectral datasets, as also, automatically calculate the mining depth and volume. A 3D visualization facility should be available to visualize the mining activity. Development of a report generation module to report the same to the respective state. A district / block boundary layer of India can be taken into consideration as training data which can be utilized for this purpose. A predefined report format may be defined by the team or mutually decided to generate the report automatically

Environmental report 
Overall Design and Tone
The report uses a striking red color scheme in its headers and key visuals, which immediately conveys a sense of urgency and warning. Unlike a neutral business dashboard, this page is structured to tell a story about environmental degradation and present a clear call to action.
Content Breakdown
The report is organized into several key sections:
📊 High-Level Impact Metrics (KPIs)
At the top, a grid of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provides a stark, at-a-glance summary of the total environmental damage. The metrics are purely environmental, focusing on things like:
      * Total Mining Area vs. Illegal Mining Area
      * Vegetation Loss in hectares
      * Quantitative scores for Water Pollution and Soil Degradation
      * Estimated Air Pollutant Emissions
📈 Area Classification & Degradation Timeline
This part of the report quantifies the scale of the problem and shows how it has worsened over time.
      * Visualizations: It uses a bar chart and a doughnut chart to show the significant proportion of mining that is illegal. A line chart tracks the sharp decline of key environmental indicators (like vegetation cover and water quality) over a three-year period. Another bar chart classifies the affected land into different severity zones(Critical, High, Medium).
      * Insights: Accompanying text explains that a large percentage of the environmental footprint comes from unauthorized operations and highlights the accelerating rate of degradation. It also defines the severity zones, noting that the most critically damaged areas could take decades to recover.
🦁 Biodiversity & Ecosystem Impact
This section focuses on the damage to the local ecosystem and wildlife.
      * Visualizations: It uses two bar charts to illustrate the percentage of species habitat loss for different types of flora and fauna (reptiles, birds, etc.) and the percentage of degradation for essential "ecosystem services" like flood control and water retention.
      * Insights: A summary explains that habitat loss has led to a severe reduction in local species and that the degradation of natural services increases environmental risks like flooding for the entire region.
✅ Mitigation & Remediation Recommendations
This is the final, action-oriented section of the report. It lays out a clear, structured plan to address the environmental damage.
      * Structure: The recommendations are logically grouped into three distinct timeframes:
      1. Immediate Actions (0-3 Months): Urgent steps like halting illegal activities and setting up monitoring.
      2. Short-Term Actions (3-12 Months): Remediation efforts like starting reforestation and reclamation of the most damaged zones.
      3. Long-Term Actions (1-5 Years): A comprehensive plan for full ecological restoration and implementing preventative policies like mandatory environmental audits.










Flowchart Explaination:


Of course! This flowchart describes an automated system for detecting and analyzing mining activity using satellite imagery and machine learning. Here's a breakdown of the process in plain words.
Phase 1: 🎓 Model Training (An Offline Preparation Step)
This initial phase is all about teaching a computer how to recognize a mine from a satellite's perspective.
      1. Data Input: The system starts with historical satellite images and corresponding ground truth data.
      2. Preparation: These images are pre-processed (cleaned up and corrected) and then carefully labeled to show exactly where mining activities are located. This creates a high-quality dataset for training.
      3. Training: A machine learning model (specifically, a segmentation model) is trained on this labeled data. It learns the visual patterns, textures, and features associated with mining operations.
      4. Outcome: The result is a Trained ML Model, which is essentially the "brain" that can now automatically spot mines in new images.
________________


Phase 2: 🔍 Detection & Analysis (The Live Pipeline)
This is the core, ongoing process where the system actively monitors a site.
      1. Live Data Input: The system takes in current satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data (for terrain height), and the official Area of Interest (AOI) boundary, which represents the legal lease area for the mine.
      2. Detection: The trained model from Phase 1 is applied to the new imagery to automatically detect and outline all mining-related activities, creating digital shapes (polygons) of these areas.
      3. Compliance Check: These detected mining shapes are compared against the legal AOI boundary. The system then automatically classifies the activity:
      * Mining inside the boundary is categorized as Legal.
      * Mining outside the boundary is flagged as potentially Illegal.
      4. Calculations: Once the areas are classified, the system calculates key metrics:
      * Area: The total size (in hectares or square meters) of both legal and illegal mining.
      * Depth: The system uses the DEM data to compare the current terrain elevation with a baseline, calculating the excavation depth.
      * Volume: Based on the area and depth, it estimates the total volume of material that has been extracted.
________________


Phase 3: 📊 Output & Reporting
In the final phase, the system organizes and presents all the analyzed data in a human-readable format.
      1. Visualization: It generates interactive 2D maps (showing legal/illegal zones) and 3D terrain models(visualizing the excavation depth).
      2. Statistics: All the calculated metrics (area, depth, volume) are compiled into easy-to-understand tables, charts, and graphs.
      3. Report Generation: Finally, a comprehensive report is automatically generated—much like the PDF you provided earlier—summarizing all the findings, visualizations, and statistics for review by authorities.
